# When using the Pronunciation Correction Tool, it's essential to interpret the results with caution for several reasons. Here's an added caution for users:

### Interpretation of Results:
+ Accuracy Limitations: The accuracy of the speech recognition and similarity comparison can be influenced by various factors, including the user's accent, speech clarity, background noise, and the quality of the microphone used for recording. Therefore, the feedback and similarity score should be seen as a guide rather than an absolute measure of pronunciation proficiency.
+ Context Sensitivity: The Levenshtein ratio measures how similar two strings of text are, but it doesn't account for the nuances of language pronunciation, such as stress, intonation, and rhythm, which are crucial for natural-sounding speech. A high similarity score might not fully reflect the quality of pronunciation in terms of these subtler aspects.
+ Personal Improvement: Focus on personal improvement over time rather than achieving a perfect score. Use the tool to practice and track progress in pronunciation, aiming for consistent improvement rather than perfection in a single attempt.
+ Professional Feedback: Consider the tool's feedback as supplementary. If serious about improving pronunciation, especially for professional or academic purposes, seek feedback from language professionals who can provide comprehensive guidance, including the nuances that automated tools cannot capture.

In summary, while the Pronunciation Correction Tool offers valuable feedback for practicing and improving pronunciation, its results should be interpreted within the context of its limitations. Continuous practice, alongside professional guidance when possible, will yield the best improvement in pronunciation skills.
