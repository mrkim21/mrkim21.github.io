# ðŸŒ± Pronunciation Checker App [Notes; Feb. 17, 2024]

This app is a Pronunciation Correction Tool designed to help users improve their pronunciation by comparing their spoken words against expected text. Here's a brief overview of how it works and some precautions for users:

# How It Works:
+ **Input Expected Text:** Users enter the text they intend to pronounce into a textbox.
+ **Upload Audio:** Users upload an audio recording of themselves pronouncing the text. The app requires the audio to be in .wav format, as it relies on this format for processing.
+ **Analysis and Feedback:** The app uses the speech_recognition library to transcribe the uploaded audio. It then compares the transcription to the expected text using the Levenshtein ratio (from the Levenshtein library) to assess similarity.
+ **Similarity Score and Feedback:** If the similarity score is above 0.8, it suggests good pronunciation. Otherwise, it advises the user to try again for clearer pronunciation. The similarity score is also provided for reference.
+ **Cautions for Users:**
  + **Audio Format:** Ensure the audio file is in .wav format. Other formats, especially TTS (Text-to-Speech) generated audio, may not be recognized properly, affecting the accuracy of transcription.
  + **Clear Pronunciation:** For the best results, pronounce words clearly and at a moderate pace. Background noise or unclear speech can significantly impact the transcription quality and, consequently, the feedback accuracy.
  + **File Info Handling:** The app processes audio by converting a NumPy array into a temporary .wav file. Users should be aware that this step is handled internally and requires no additional action on their part, but it underscores the importance of the audio file's initial format and quality.
  + **Error Handling:** Be prepared for potential errors, such as "Could not understand audio" if the speech is unclear or "Could not request results" if there's an issue with the speech recognition service.

This tool is intended to provide users with an interactive way to practice and refine their pronunciation by leveraging automatic speech recognition and similarity assessment technologies.

When using the Pronunciation Correction Tool, it's essential to interpret the results with caution for several reasons. Here's an added caution for users:

# Interpretation of Results (caution):
+ **Accuracy Limitations:** The accuracy of the speech recognition and similarity comparison can be influenced by various factors, including the user's accent, speech clarity, background noise, and the quality of the microphone used for recording. Therefore, the feedback and similarity score should be seen as a guide rather than an absolute measure of pronunciation proficiency.
+ **Context Sensitivity:** The Levenshtein ratio measures how similar two strings of text are, but it doesn't account for the nuances of language pronunciation, such as stress, intonation, and rhythm, which are crucial for natural-sounding speech. A high similarity score might not fully reflect the quality of pronunciation in terms of these subtler aspects.
+ **Personal Improvement:** Focus on personal improvement over time rather than achieving a perfect score. Use the tool to practice and track progress in pronunciation, aiming for consistent improvement rather than perfection in a single attempt.
+ **Professional Feedback:** Consider the tool's feedback as supplementary. If serious about improving pronunciation, especially for professional or academic purposes, seek feedback from language professionals who can provide comprehensive guidance, including the nuances that automated tools cannot capture.

In summary, while the Pronunciation Correction Tool offers valuable feedback for practicing and improving pronunciation, its results should be interpreted within the context of its limitations. Continuous practice, alongside professional guidance when possible, will yield the best improvement in pronunciation skills.
